### Project Description
This medication management app helps elderly individuals track and manage their medication schedules by sending timely reminders and logging doses taken. It also offers caregiver support, integrates with health data, and includes accessible features to ensure ease of use for seniors.

### The Problem statement
Many elderly people forget to take their medications on time due to memory issues and complicated schedules. This can cause health problems and more hospital visits. We need a solution implemented using technology that provides caregiver support and healthcare methods to help them manage their medications¬†better.

### The Solution
An app to help elderly people manage their medications can be a game-changer in improving their health outcomes. We created an app called MyMedPal which provides all such necessary reminders and details regarding the dosage, drug administration, etc of the medicines. Such an app can become an essential tool in managing the health of elderly people, allowing them to maintain their independence while ensuring proper medication adherence.
